 1) Implemented batch loading using UNWIND in load_to_neo4j.py. This significantly reduced the number of database transactions and dramatically improved loading speed.

 2)Context Summarization: I integrated a _get_search_summary() function. This function acts as an intermediate reasoning step. It takes the raw data retrieved from the databases and uses a fast LLM call to create a clean, concise summary. This summary is then used as the context for the final answer, which reduces noise and improves the focus of the generation step.

 3)Advanced Prompt Engineering: To improve accuracy, the initial simple prompt was upgraded to a sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt. This new prompt forces the AI to follow a structured reasoning process:

    a) Analyze the user's goal.

    b) Review the provided context.

    c) Check if the context is sufficient to answer.

    d) Formulate a plan.

    e) Generate the final answer

4)Caching for Embeddings: The most significant performance improvement was adding a caching layer for the expensive OpenAI embedding calls using external Redis cache . 

5) Asynchronous Backend: The backend was built using FastAPI, an async-native framework. The API endpoints were defined as async def, allowing the server to handle many concurrent user requests without being blocked by slow network operations (like API calls). This makes the application highly scalable .
